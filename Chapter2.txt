Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into war with the Cabal on Mars, so 
lets get to taking out their command one by one. Valus Ta'aruc, from what I can
gather, he controls a land tank just outside Rubicon, with the right team, we 
can punch through his defenses, take this beast out and break their grip 
on Freehold.
