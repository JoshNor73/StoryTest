In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood.
He chose the path of perpetual torment, and in his ravenous hatred, he found no
peace, and woth boiling blood, he scouered the umbral plains, seeking vengance 
against the Dark Lords who had wronged him. Unbreakable, incorruptible,
unyielding. None could stand before the hoard but the Doom Slayer, for he alone
was the Hellwalker.
